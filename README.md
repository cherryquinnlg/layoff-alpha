# layoff-alpha

2021-2023 has seen an unprecedented wave of layoffs across Silicon Valley, following massive hiring early into the pandemic. Layoffs can often be interpreted as a way to reduce redundancy, and as such, may signal increased future profitability. Many technology companies have indeed experienced a rise in stock price in the months after post-pandemic. In this project, I used layoff announcement as a low-frequency signal for trading technology stocks. I firstly performed backtesting with hundreds of stocks (mainly in the US) between Jan 2020 and Sept 2023 using python backtrader library, before building a custom backtesting dashboard from scratch with streamlit. Finally, I created a news bot that alerts me future layoff announcements. This end-to-end project is a formalization / automation of one of my personal discretionary trading strategies.
